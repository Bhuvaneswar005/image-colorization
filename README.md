# Image Colorization
This project takes an input grayscale image and produces the output as a colourized image. It works based on a deep learning method. LAB colour space is used where ‘L’ lightness intensity is the input and the network is trained to predict ‘a’ and ‘b’ channels, which are green-red and blue-yellow colour balances, respectively.
